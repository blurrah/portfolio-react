# Portfolio React

Just remaking my portfolio site in ReactJS with Alt as the Flux implementation.
Transpiled from ES6+ES7 using Babel.

## TODO
- Make it look sharp
- Add detailed portfolio item view
- Make it isomorphic
- Make tests
- Replace Superagent with Fetch API
- Replace Browserify with Webpack + react-hot-loader
- Production deployment + Continuous integration
